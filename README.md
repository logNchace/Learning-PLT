# Learning Matplotlib with AI Assistance

I'm learning to code with **Matplotlib** while using AI to assist in the process.  
If you're interested in learning too, here's a simple **step-by-step approach** to get started:  

## ðŸ“Œ Step-by-Step Learning Process  

### 1. Find Relevant Data  
- Look for interesting statistics or datasets you want to visualize.  
- Choose a topic that interests you to stay engaged.  

### 2. Describe Your Idea to AI  
- Explain that you want to create a **plot in Python**.  
- Specify the **type of graph** (e.g., line chart, bar graph, scatter plot).  

### 3. Analyze the Generated Code  
- Once the AI provides a script, **go through it carefully**.  
- Understand each function and parameter used in the code.
- Don't hesitate to ask want ceratin blocks of code do.  

### 4. Try Writing It on Your Own  
- When starting a new plot, **refer back to previous examples**.  
- Attempt to write the code from scratch **until you get stuck**.  

### 5. Use AI for Assistance  
- Copy what you managed to write and **paste it into the AI**.  
- Provide **clear instructions** so the AI builds on your progress.  

### 6. Repeat the Process  
- Continue refining your skills by iterating on different plots.  
- Each attempt will help solidify your understanding.  

ðŸ”„ **Practice, experiment, and have fun!** The more you apply this method, the easier it becomes. ðŸš€
